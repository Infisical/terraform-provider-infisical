## Schema

### Required

- `identity_id` (String) The ID of the identity to attach the configuration onto.

### Optional

- `access_token_max_ttl` (Number) The maximum lifetime for an access token in seconds. This value will be referenced at renewal time. Default: 2592000
- `access_token_num_uses_limit` (Number) The maximum number of times that an access token can be used; a value of 0 implies infinite number of uses. Default:0
- `access_token_trusted_ips` (Attributes List) A list of IPs or CIDR ranges that access tokens can be used from. You can use 0.0.0.0/0, to allow usage from any network address.. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--access_token_trusted_ips))
- `access_token_ttl` (Number) The lifetime for an access token in seconds. This value will be referenced at renewal time. Default: 2592000
- `allowed_account_ids` (List of String) List of trusted AWS account IDs that are allowed to authenticate with Infisical.
- `allowed_principal_arns` (List of String) List of trusted IAM principal ARNs that are allowed to authenticate with Infisical.

Using a wildcard in this case allows any IAM principal in the account `123456789012` to authenticate with Infisical under the identity
