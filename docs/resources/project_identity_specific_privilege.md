  }
}

provider "infisical" {
  host          = "https://app.infisical.com" # Only required if using self hosted instance of Infisical, default is https://app.infisical.com

}

resource "infisical_project" "example" {

  slug = "example"
}

resource "infisical_project_identity" "test-identity" {
  project_id  = infisical_project.example.id
  identity_id = "<identity id>"
  roles = [
    {
      role_slug = "admin"
    }
  ]
}

resource "infisical_project_identity_specific_privilege" "test-privilege" {
